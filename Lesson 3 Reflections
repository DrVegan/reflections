When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When working with a team on the same project. teams can make branches and work on indvidule sections and then push the changes back to the master.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	when you are in the middle of completely a logical update that doesnâ€™t interfere with other parts of a file / program

 ** Commands
 git remote						// show a list of current remotes
 git add remote [remote name] [https address]		// adds new remote on Github
 git pull [remote name] [branch name]			// makes pull request from Github
 pit push [remote name] [branch name]			// pushes local changes to server
